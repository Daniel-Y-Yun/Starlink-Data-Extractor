# Starlink Data Extractor
 # This program provides a .json of every functioning Starlink satellite's NORAD ID  # grouped by their launch dates. It also has the functionality to provide all of  # the table data for each satellite (although it is not included in the final .json).  # The data is taken from the <tbody> portion on the "Starlink Satellites" website # from NORAD which displays the name, NORAD ID, Int'l Code, and Launch Date # for every functioning Starlink satellite.  # Data from NORAD as of 10/22/2023
